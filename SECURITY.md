# Spicy Lyrics - Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability affecting
any part of this project, please report it responsibly using **one of the
methods below**.

### Preferred: GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting

For vulnerabilities affecting repositories hosted on GitHub, please use
**GitHub’s Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature. This allows you to
confidentially report security issues directly through the repository,
without public disclosure.

This is the **recommended** reporting method for GitHub-hosted components.

### Alternative: Email

If GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting is unavailable or unsuitable
for your report, you may contact us via email.

**Email:** hi@spicylyrics.org

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or proof-of-concept details

**Do not** open public GitHub issues or pull requests to report
security vulnerabilities.

## Project Scope

This project is a multi-component application consisting of:

- Frontend application (open source, Spicetify extension)
- Backend services (private, SaaS)
- Public but closed-source services
- Supporting websites, APIs, and infrastructure

Security reports affecting **any component of the project** are in scope,
even when the affected component is closed-source, private, or operated
as a hosted service.

---

## CVE Policy

CVE identifiers may be issued only for vulnerabilities affecting
publicly distributed components.

Vulnerabilities limited to backend services, private infrastructure,
or hosted-only components may be documented without a CVE identifier.

---

## Disclosure

We review security reports internally and determine appropriate
remediation and disclosure on a case-by-case basis.

We ask that security issues are not publicly disclosed before we have
had an opportunity to review and address the report.
